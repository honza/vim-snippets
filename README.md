Snipmate & UltiSnip Snippets
============================

This repository contains snippets files for various programming languages.

It is community-maintained and many people have contributed snippet files and other
improvements already.

Contents

    snippets/*: snippets using snipmate format
    UltiSnips/*: snippets using UltiSnips format

Snippet engines
===============

There are different forks of snippet engines which allow the user to insert
sippets by typing the name of a snippet hitting the expansion mapping.

    garbas/vim-snipmate [4]:
      VimL, snipmate-snippets, engine sometimes behaves strange, supports
      rewriting snippets on the fly (eg adding a second version with folding
      markers)

    MarcWeber/UltiSnips [6]:
      python, snipmate-snippets and UltiSnips-snippets

    SirVer/ultisnips [7]:
      python, UltiSnips-snippets

    github.com/Shougo/neosnippet [5]:
      viml, has a compatible mode allowing to reuse most snipmate snippets ?

    XPTemplate:
      totally different syntax, does not read snippets contained in this file,
      but it is also very powerful

    ... there are some more, but they have less features which is why I don't
    mention them here

UltiSnips engine has additional features such as "nested snippets".

Which one to use? If you have python give MarcWeber/UltiSnips a try because its
fast and supports all important features. You can prefer the UltiSnip versions
of the snippets by setting the "always_use_first_snippet" option to 1.

If you have VimL only (vim without python support) your best option is using
garbas/vim-snipmate and cope with the minor bugs found in the engine.

Historical notes
================

[vim-snipmate][1] was originally started by [Michael Sanders][2] who has now
unfortunately abandoned the project. [Rok Garbas][3] is now maintaining a
[fork][4] of the project in hopes of improving the existing code base.


Language maintainers

No one can really be proficient in all programming languages. If you would like
to maintain snippets for a language, please get in touch.

Contributing notes
------------------

Until further work is done on `vim-snipmate`, please don't add folding markers
into snippets. `vim-snipmate` has some comments about how to patch all snippets
on the fly adding those.

Because MarcWeber/UltiSnips [6] supports also snipmate-snippets there is no
need to duplicate all snippets - only those snippets who use advanced UltiSnips
features should be duplicated in UltiSnips (?)

Currently all snippets from UltiSnips have been put into UltiSnips - some work
on merging should be done (dropping duplicates etc)
