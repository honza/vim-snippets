Snipmate Snippets
=================

This repository contains snippets files for various programming languages for
the famous [snipMate][1] plugin for vim. This repository is
community-maintained and many people have contributed snippet files and other
improvements already.

[vim-snipmate][1] was originally started by [Michael Sanders][2] who has now
unfortunately abandoned the project. [Rok Garbas][3] is now maintaining a
[fork][4] of the project in hopes of improving the existing code base.
